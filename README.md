# Application that tracks jogging times of users
+ User must be able to create an account and log in.
+ When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete his times he entered.
+ Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
+ Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time.
+ When displayed, each time entry has average speed.
+ Filter by dates from-to.
+ Report on average speed & distance per week.
+ REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication
+ All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
